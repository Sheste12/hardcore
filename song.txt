nothing,nowhere â€” sinker

[Chorus]
We try to go back
But it's not the same
You can call back
But I don't know what to say
Was it my fault?
I guess things fade
So when we part ways
Just remember my face
We try to go back
But it's not the same
You can call back
But I don't know what to say
Was it my fault?
I guess things fade
So when we part ways
Just remember my face

[Verse 1]
And I'm so low
Tired of feeling like I'm never worth it
Anti-social
I only see the world looking through my curtains
Time wasted
This will never work out, time to face it
No patience
Push you away, jealousy and self-hatred

[Chorus]
