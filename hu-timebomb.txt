I'm a social casualty, watching all your vanity
You'll become a memory in someone else's legacy, yeah
Fuck the trendsetters, social pressure's the enemy
Someone else's life is becoming your identity
I walk the line one step at a time
All these motherfuckers try to keep me in line
This pressure I can't take, any more and I'll break
You'll crumble in my wake, better listen when I say
There's gotta be a way
Something's gotta change, something's gotta change
And now I swear I'm blind
Looking for the light I can never find
I just wanna live before I die
Over and over in my mind
And I cannot seem to run, cannot seem to fight
I just wanna live before I die
Over and over in my mind
Over and over in my mind
Fuck what the people say, I'm hearing evil things
On bloody knees I pray, my demons, they got angel wings
It's retribution now, the revolution sound
You're execution bound, and it's time to burn it down
Doomsday, I think it's coming, getting close, but I keep on runnin'
Try to make me feel like nothing, now my hate's turned into somethin'
I feel it deep inside, these demons will not die
I tried to run and hide, but now it's time to say goodbye
There's gotta be a way
Something's gotta change, something's gotta change
And now I swear I'm blind
Looking for the light I can never find
I just wanna live before I die
Over and over in my mind
And I cannot seem to run, cannot seem to fight
I just wanna live before I die
Over and over in my mind
Over and over, mind
I'm a fucking time bomb
A motherfucking time bomb
I'm a fucking time bomb
A motherfucking time bomb
I'm a fucking time bomb
A motherfucking time bomb
I'm a fucking time bomb
And you're running out of time
Blind
Looking for the light I can never find
I just wanna live before I die
Over and over in my mind
And now I swear I'm blind
Looking for the light I can never find
I just wanna live before I die
Over and over in my mind
And I cannot seem to run, cannot seem to fight
I just wanna live before I die
Over and over in my mind
Over and over, mind
I'm a fucking time bomb
A motherfucking time bomb
I'm a fucking time bomb
And you're running out of time
